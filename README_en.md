This is the unofficial code analysis library of the more popular online evaluation system (such as Luogu, LeetCode, CCF programming online evaluation system, etc.), computer programming guide library, algorithm analysis library, industry major news / news push library , `In order to facilitate the students to refer to the questions that will not be, we will explain the algorithm and process in detail for everyone.` We are interested to see if you are interested in this project, please click on Star, the project will Long-term update, thank you for your support.

### Introduction

Each evaluation system solves the problem and records its own solution.

The library is now divided into the following four sections:

1. Evaluation system title answer algorithm and analysis;
2. Algorithm diagram;
3. Featured Topic Pushing `One Daily Question is an activity in the exchange group (QQ or other). Let's solve a problem together, so that the discussion questions are more concentrated and more feedback will be obtained. And these questions can be recorded, and the problem solving module added to the warehouse will be filtered in the future`;
4. Selected algorithms/article recommendations;
5. Plan `This will record the future to be added to the above three parts`;

### about me

I am a developer interested in technology, good at server communication, client development and interaction, front-end standard development, database design.
I have done .NET, SQL, WPF, C#, C++, HTML, and now I am a "Begging engineer."

### Guide

- For the recently added part, there will be ✔ mark later
- For the most recently updated section, there will be a 🆙 mark

The algorithms are mainly the following:

- Basic skills: divide, divide, greedy
- Sorting algorithm: quick sort, merge sort, count sort
- Search algorithms: backtracking, recursion, depth-first traversal, breadth-first traversal, binary search tree, etc.
- Graph theory: shortest path, minimum spanning tree
- Dynamic planning: knapsack problem, longest subsequence

The data structure is mainly as follows:

- Arrays and linked lists: single / doubly linked list
- Stacks and queues
- Hash table
- Heap: Maximum heap / Minimum heap
- Trees and maps: recent public ancestors, and collection
- String: prefix tree (dictionary tree) / suffix tree

### group chat

>Because of the various reasons such as the initial stage, we still use the QQ group as the communication medium for the time being.

We do not exclude novice friends, as long as you love, we welcome you!
